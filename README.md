# Time-Series-Forecasting
### Fundamentally FORECASTING differ with PREDICTION so, it is really imporatant to understand the difference and application of it.
### This repo is dedicated to give you a basic and progressive idea of time series forecasting. Please follow the below order while reading the notebooks.
### Note: I will update regularly for all topics.
#### 1. introduction to time series 
#### 2. EWMA (exponential weighted moving averages)
#### 3. holt-winters method
#### 4. general forecatsing techniques
#### 5. stationary and non-stationary (includes ACF & PACF)
#### 6. ARIMA introduction (no code because ARIMA models are used at very specific conditions and it didn't suitable for real time data with different input attributes)
#### 7. SARIMA part 1
#### 8. SARIMAX part 2 (real time model because it deals with X (input attributes as well)
#### 9. VAR (vector autoregression) model
#### 10. VARMA (vector auto regression moving averages) model
#### 11. Forecasting using RNNs (deep learning)
